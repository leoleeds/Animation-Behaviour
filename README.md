# Animation-Behaviour

Result from the Animation/Behaviour practical for GEOG5003M: Programming for Geographical Information Analysis.

Please open the Model.py file and run in suitable environment (e.g. Spyder). Output should include: 1. An animated scatter plot of environment and agents, showing 100 agents per frame, for 10 frames; 2. An example original and moved coordinates to verify that the code has functioned correctly; 3. The time taken to execute the code in seconds.

The Environment should export to a .csv when the model is executed.

The model at various stages of development following previous practicals is available in the following GitHub repositories:
1. Agents! - https://github.com/leoleeds/Agents
2. I/O - https://github.com/leoleeds/I-O
3. Communicating - https://github.com/leoleeds/Communicating
